# Thesis
Here is most of the code used for my thesis on using deep learning to improve the quality of luminescence images.
Some of the code requires to be run on a GPU and some require you to provide your own data.

See the README BM3D for the credits of the BM3D code. BM3D.py was modified for this project.
